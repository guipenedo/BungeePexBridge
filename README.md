# BungeePexBridge
BungeePexBridge is a plugin for bungeecord (https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/bungeecord/) that imports permissions from a MySQL database. It supports plugins like PermissionsEx and SexyPex and it allows you to sync your permissions from bukkit/spigot to bungeecord without having to manually add groups/users to bungeecord's config.yml file.
